Valid interfaces are:


EOD;

	}

If you don't know the names of your interfaces, you may choose to use
auto-detection. In that case, disconnect all interfaces before you begin,
and reconnect each one when prompted to do so.

			echo "\nInvalid interface name '{$lanif}'\n";
			unset($lanif);
			continue;
		}
	} while (!$lanif);
	
	
	echo <<<EOD
	
The interfaces will be assigned as follows:

LAN  -> {$lanif}


The PBX will reboot after saving the changes.

Do you want to proceed? (y/n)

Connect the {$ifname} interface now and make sure that the link is up.
Then press ENTER to continue.
