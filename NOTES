pb8

new features
 - followme
 - add iax2 auth options
   - pubkey import
   - md5
 - iax jitter buffer options, notes at bottom!!!
 - ISDN
   - dialing failures need debugging
 - multilanguage e-mail greetings!!!
 - "Statu -> Interfaces" needs to display ISDN interface information!!!

fixes
 - is_valid_xxx checks need to be completed!!!
 - use posted config in dialplan providers instead of making users start all over
 - extension_exists() really needs to work

improvements
 - dialplan (still needs (de)select all)
 - improve module population in pbxdev
 - figure out DID!!!
 - start returning get_blahs() functions by reference
 _ also, get_blahs() should return arrays with uniqid's as the keys
 - kernel and asterisk modules should only be loaded when needed
 - ISDN interfaces for providers and phones should be limited to appropriate choices (NT vs TE)

pb9
 - storage interface (add storage partition for extended capabilities)
 - extended capabilities hooks into the gui
 - new option to log to storage partition
 - privacy with voicemail forward

Docs:
 - presentation
 - website
 - user documentation

- get "advanced mode" working
- provider to provider access with pin code
- QoS options, such as jitterbuffer and packet types supported
- dialplan as a movable grid
- testing / performance mode
- get indications.conf working
- figure out config xml single var irregularities (empty defines showing up)
- url given in console menu should match port given in gui (m0n0wall bug)

; --[ jitter buffer ]-------------------------------------------------------------
; You can adjust several parameters relating to the jitter buffer.
; The jitter buffer's function is to compensate for varying
; network delay.
;
; All the jitter buffer settings are in milliseconds.
; The jitter buffer works for INCOMING audio - the outbound audio
; will be dejittered by the jitter buffer at the other end.
;
; jitterbuffer=yes|no: global default as to whether you want
; the jitter buffer at all.
;
; forcejitterbuffer=yes|no: in the ideal world, when we bridge VoIP channels
; we don't want to do jitterbuffering on the switch, since the endpoints
; can each handle this.  However, some endpoints may have poor jitterbuffers 
; themselves, so this option will force * to always jitterbuffer, even in this
; case.
;
; maxjitterbuffer: a maximum size for the jitter buffer.
; Setting a reasonable maximum here will prevent the call delay
; from rising to silly values in extreme situations; you'll hear
; SOMETHING, even though it will be jittery.
;
; resyncthreshold: when the jitterbuffer notices a significant change in delay
; that continues over a few frames, it will resync, assuming that the change in
; delay was caused by a timestamping mix-up. The threshold for noticing a
; change in delay is measured as twice the measured jitter plus this resync
; threshold.
; Resyncing can be disabled by setting this parameter to -1.
;
; maxjitterinterps: the maximum number of interpolation frames the jitterbuffer
; should return in a row. Since some clients do not send CNG/DTX frames to
; indicate silence, the jitterbuffer will assume silence has begun after
; returning this many interpolations. This prevents interpolating throughout
; a long silence.
