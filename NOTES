closed bugs in 1.4 svn, open in 1.4.12
 - 10877 (rtp unknown event creating NULL dtmf, one-way audio)


pb11
 - provider / phone status indicators on edit page

 - fix extensions_exists
 - fix dialplan_providers.php to save posted config and display correctly when no providers are present
 - complete is_valid_xxx() checks
 - normalize all single var irregularities, maybe even write a cleanup when upgrading to config.xml 1.2
 - confirm "Ringing()" behavior/usage on ISDN connections

 - streaming moh
 - test incoming extensions
 - check about dtmf bursts after picking analog phones
 - fix snooze
 - get a iax client working ... figure out what's going on there

 - single tone voicemails...

-----------------

- enable sip/iax/isdn/analog debug options on pbx log page
- extend callgroup support to add delays, sequential groups
- storage interface (add storage partition for extended capabilities)
- extended capabilities hooks into the gui
- new option to log to storage partition
- multiple MSNs on ISDN, DID/DDI support in general

 - gtalk
 - ajaxify logs page
 - dialplan (still needs (de)select all)
 - start returning get_blahs() functions by reference
 _ also, get_blahs() should return arrays with uniqid's as the keys
 - kernel and asterisk modules should only be loaded when needed
 - privacy with voicemail forward
 - followme
 - add iax2 auth options
   - pubkey import
 - get "advanced mode" working
 - provider to provider access with pin code
 - QoS options, such as jitterbuffer and packet types supported
 - testing / performance mode




; --[ jitter buffer ]-------------------------------------------------------------
; All the jitter buffer settings are in milliseconds.
; The jitter buffer works for INCOMING audio - the outbound audio
; will be dejittered by the jitter buffer at the other end.
;
; maxjitterbuffer: a maximum size for the jitter buffer.
; Setting a reasonable maximum here will prevent the call delay
; from rising to silly values in extreme situations; you'll hear
; SOMETHING, even though it will be jittery.
;
; resyncthreshold: when the jitterbuffer notices a significant change in delay
; that continues over a few frames, it will resync, assuming that the change in
; delay was caused by a timestamping mix-up. The threshold for noticing a
; change in delay is measured as twice the measured jitter plus this resync
; threshold.
; Resyncing can be disabled by setting this parameter to -1.
;
; maxjitterinterps: the maximum number of interpolation frames the jitterbuffer
; should return in a row. Since some clients do not send CNG/DTX frames to
; indicate silence, the jitterbuffer will assume silence has begun after
; returning this many interpolations. This prevents interpolating throughout
; a long silence.
;

;maxjitterbuffer=1000
;maxjitterinterps=10
;resyncthreshold=1000

;courtesytone = beep		; Sound file to play to the parked caller 
				; when someone dials a parked call
				; or the Touch Monitor is activated/deactivated.
;parkedplay = caller		; Who to play the courtesy tone to when picking up a parked call
				; one of: parked, caller, both  (default is caller)
;adsipark = yes			; if you want ADSI parking announcements
;findslot => next		; Continue to the 'next' free parking space. 
				; Defaults to 'first' available
;parkedmusicclass=default	; This is the MOH class to use for the parked channel
				; as long as the class is not set on the channel directly
				; using Set(CHANNEL(musicclass)=whatever) in the dialplan

;transferdigittimeout => 3	; Number of seconds to wait between digits when transferring a call
				; (default is 3 seconds)
;xfersound = beep		; to indicate an attended transfer is complete
;xferfailsound = beeperr	; to indicate a failed transfer
;pickupexten = *8		; Configure the pickup extension. (default is *8)


[featuremap]
;disconnect => *0		; Disconnect  (default is *)
;automon => *1			; One Touch Record a.k.a. Touch Monitor
;parkcall => #72                ; Park call (one step parking)

**** Michael, if you add this to the internal context hints will work for
parking spots:

exten => 701,1,ParkedCall(701)
exten => 701,hint,park:701@parkedcalls

Of course you would add an entry for each parking spot.
