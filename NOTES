- nat=yes|no optional an all sip accounts
- dial timeout options
- check about dtmf bursts after picking analog phones
- single tone voicemails...
- multiple incoming extensions shouldn't be an option for providers lacking that ability ?
- readback numbers should be definable for each of the incoming extensions
- deleting a provider breaks external phones...warn? suggest?
- "forget" interface details option
- remove "device report" info from interface pages
- set a more sensible default for analog phone echo canceller size
- difference between incoming extensions and callgroups should be made clear in the gui
	- perhaps destinations defined with the same pattern should be treated as improv-callgroups
- start writing short wiki entries for new features as they are impelemented

storage
- device states: unconfigured, configured, inactive, active, healthy, dirty, clean, mounted, unmounted...?!
- fs options?
- ajax format status bar
- what happens when da0 is recognized as da1 and v.v, how to get a uniqid for each disk

general improvements
- better documentation on codec options (passthru esp.)
- all data should be accessed with a function, no more direct $config queries
- multiple vs single displays of a gui element on a page should be generalized, there are 5 wheels here already...
- translation storage should be generalized and combined with help.inc
- guiconfig.inc is huge...
- searching dmesg output should be put into a function

sooner
- fix extensions_exists
- fix dialplan_providers.php to save posted config and display correctly when no providers are present
- complete is_valid_xxx() checks
- normalize all single var irregularities, maybe even write a cleanup when upgrading to config.xml 1.2
- confirm "Ringing()" behavior/usage on ISDN connections
- start returning get_blahs() functions by reference
_ also, get_blahs() should return arrays with uniqid's as the keys
- kernel and asterisk modules should only be loaded when needed
- publicly reachable extension, e-mail style extension overrides


later
- qos page with jitterbuffer tab
- time based call routing
- better front panel w/quick access to call logs, etc
- disable/enable options for each provider and phone
- storage interface (add storage partition for extended capabilities)
- extended capabilities hooks into the gui
- new option to log to storage partition
- get "advanced mode" working
- provider / phone status indicators on edit page
- add "Entities -> Users"
- dialplan (still needs (de)select all)
- add iax2 auth options
	- pubkey import
- enable sip/iax/isdn/analog debug options on pbx log page
- extend callgroup support to add delays, sequential groups
- privacy with voicemail forward
- cryptographically verifiable, encryptable config.xmls
- provider to provider access with pin code
- QoS options, such as jitterbuffer and packet types supported


much later
- streaming moh

- ajaxify logs page
- testing / performance mode
